## Executive Summary

This document describes the methodology used to identify Industrial Outdoor Storage (IOS) investment opportunities in the Denver metro area, specifically Adams County.

**Key Results:**
- Analyzed **187,407 parcels** in Adams County
- Identified **275 A-grade** and **3,770 B-grade** IOS candidates using our scoring system
- Applied Apricus investment criteria filters to narrow to **727 qualified properties** (A/B + relaxed criteria)
- **95 properties** meet exact Apricus criteria (A-grade + 3-15 acres + sub 20% coverage + $3-15M value)

The scoring system was specifically designed around Apricus Realty Capital's published investment criteria to ensure alignment with your acquisition parameters.

## Apricus Investment Criteria

*Source: apricusrealtycapital.com*

| Criteria | Apricus Requirement |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Purchase Price** | $3-15 million gross |
| **Building Coverage** | Sub 20% (will consider higher if critical site use is outdoor storage) |
| **Parcel Size** | Prefer 3-15 acres |
| **Product Type** | Infill IOS |
| **Target Uses** | Truck/trailer, building materials, equipment storage/rental, container yards, bulk materials, fleet parking |
| **Market Tier** | Denver is Tier 2 market |

---

## How We Aligned Our Scoring

The scoring system evaluates properties across 6 dimensions, with weights calibrated to Apricus criteria:

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Building Coverage** | 30% | Highest weight - critical for IOS (less coverage = more outdoor storage space) |
| **Parcel Size** | 25% | Optimal range set to 3-15 acres per Apricus preference |
| **Zoning** | 20% | Industrial/storage-friendly zoning required for IOS use |
| **Land Use** | 15% | Current use keywords from Apricus target tenant list |
| **Structural** | 5% | Building count/size affects conversion potential |
| **Location** | 5% | DIA proximity, industrial corridor access |

---

### 1. Parcel Size Scoring (25% weight)

Aligned directly with Apricus "Prefer 3-15 acres" guidance:

| Acres | Score | Alignment |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 0-1 | 0 | Too small for IOS operations |
| 1-2 | 40 | Marginal |
| 2-3 | 70 | Good, slightly below preference |
| **3-15** | **100** | **Optimal - matches Apricus preference** |
| 15-20 | 80 | Larger but workable |
| 20-30 | 60 | Large |
| 30+ | 40 | Very large, may require subdivision |

---

### 2. Building Coverage Scoring (30% weight)

Highest weight because this is critical for IOS viability. Aligned with "sub 20% building coverage":

| Coverage | Score | Alignment |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 0-5% | 95 | Mostly open - excellent for IOS |
| 5-15% | 100 | **Optimal** - allows office/shop with maximum outdoor space |
| 15-20% | 85 | Good - within Apricus "sub 20%" threshold |
| 20-25% | 70 | Marginal - exceeds threshold but may qualify if outdoor storage use |
| 25-35% | 60 | Poor |
| 35%+ | 0-30 | Not suitable for IOS |

*Note: Per Apricus criteria, "will consider higher if critical site use is outdoor storage" - properties with higher coverage but IOS-compatible current use are flagged in analysis notes.*

---

### 3. Zoning Scoring (20% weight)

Mapped all Adams County zoning codes to IOS compatibility:

| Zoning Category | Codes | Score |
|-----------------|-------|-------|
| **Industrial** | I-1, I-2, I-3, M-1, M-2, IL, IH | 100 |
| Heavy Commercial | C-5 | 75 |
| Highway Commercial | C-4 | 65 |
| Agricultural | A-1, A-2, A-3 | 55 |
| Planned Development | P-U-D, AV | 50 |
| Community Commercial | C-2, C-0 | 40 |
| Residential | R-1, R-2, etc. | 10 |

**Bonus scoring** for zoning descriptions containing: "outdoor storage" (+15), "contractor" (+10), "equipment" (+10), "yard" (+5)

---

### 4. Land Use Scoring (15% weight)

Keywords sourced directly from Apricus target tenant uses:

| Use Type | Score | Apricus Alignment |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Outdoor storage, contractor yard, container yard | 100 | Direct match |
| **Truck trailer, trailer parking, fleet parking** | 100 | "truck trailer" |
| **Equipment storage, equipment rental** | 95 | "equipment storage/rental" |
| **Building materials, bulk materials** | 95 | "building materials, bulk materials" |
| Vehicle storage, industrial yard, storage yard | 90 | IOS-compatible |
| Vacant land | 75 | Conversion opportunity |
| Industrial | 70 | Compatible |
| Warehouse, logistics, trucking | 55-70 | Related uses |
| Commercial | 40-50 | May require rezoning |
| Residential | 10 | Not suitable |

---

### 5. Structural Scoring (5% weight)

Fewer and smaller buildings = easier IOS conversion, lower demolition costs:

**Base score: 50**, with adjustments:

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| 0 buildings (vacant) | +20 |
| 1 building | +10 |
| 2-3 buildings | 0 |
| 4+ buildings | -10 |
| Small building (<2,000 sqft) | +20 |
| Medium building (2,000-10,000 sqft) | 0 to +10 |
| Large building (>10,000 sqft) | -20 |

---

### 6. Location Scoring (5% weight)

- **Base score: 60** for properties in target industrial area
- **DIA proximity bonus: +15** (logistics hub advantage)

Denver/Adams County qualifies as a Tier 2 market per Apricus criteria.

## Grade Classification

Composite scores are classified into grades:

| Grade | Score Range | Count | Interpretation |
|-------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| **A** | 85-100 | 275 | Excellent IOS Candidate - Best alignment with all criteria |
| **B** | 75-84 | 3,770 | Good IOS Candidate - Strong potential |
| C | 65-74 | 7,299 | Moderate - May require flexibility on some criteria |
| D | 50-64 | 70,323 | Marginal - Limited IOS suitability |
| F | 0-49 | 105,740 | Poor - Not recommended for IOS use |

**Total A+B candidates: 4,045 properties** before applying investment criteria filters.

---

## Investment Criteria Filters Applied

After scoring, we applied Apricus-specific filters:

### Exact Match Criteria
| Criteria | Filter Applied |
|----------|----------------|
| IOS Grade | A only |
| Parcel Size | 3-15 acres |
| Building Coverage | Sub 20% |
| Assessed Value | $3-15 million |

**Result: 95 properties**

### Relaxed Match Criteria
| Criteria | Filter Applied |
|----------|----------------|
| IOS Grade | A or B |
| Parcel Size | 2-20 acres |
| Building Coverage | Sub 25% |
| Assessed Value | $2-20 million |

**Result: 727 properties**

---

## Value Filter Note

Our data includes **assessed values** (actual_total_value from Adams County Assessor). Important considerations:

1. **Assessed value ≠ market value** - Actual purchase prices may differ
2. We applied the $3-15M filter as a directional proxy
3. Properties near the boundaries may still qualify at market pricing
4. The Excel deliverable includes value data for your own filtering

## Next Steps / Feedback Requested

1. **Scoring weights** - Are the current weights appropriate, or should we adjust emphasis?
2. **Value filtering** - Should we use a different proxy for the $3-15M target?
3. **Submarket focus** - Any specific corridors or areas to prioritize (I-70, I-76, DIA)?
4. **Additional data** - Owner contact information, tax status, environmental factors?
5. **Exclusions** - Any property types to exclude (government, utilities, etc.)?
