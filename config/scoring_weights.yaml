# IOS (Industrial Outdoor Storage) Scoring Configuration

# Dimension weights for composite score calculation
weights:

  building_coverage: 0.30 # 30% - CRITICAL: Building coverage (inverted - less is better)
  zoning: 0.20           # 20% - Zoning compatibility
  land_use: 0.15         # 15% - Current land use classification
